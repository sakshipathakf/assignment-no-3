#Question 3 Write a code snippet to find the dimensions of a ndarray an

d its size.

arr = np.array( [[ 1, 2, 3]

[ 4, 9, 5]])

print("Array is of type: ", type(arr

)) print("No. of dimensions: ", arr.ndi

m) print("Shape of array: ", arr. shape) print("Size of array: ", arr.size)

Array is of type: <class 'numpy.nda

rray'> No. of dimensions: 2

Shape of array: (2, 3) Size of array: 6
